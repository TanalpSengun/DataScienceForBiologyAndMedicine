When I was in exchange semester in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology I took this course called Data Science for Biology and Medicine.

The following is the code for the individual project assignment in that course.

Liver cancer is significant cancer in Hong Kong still need to be studied. In this study, I would like to explore the factors which are highly related to survival to the liver cancer patients using R Language. In my study, the data was taken from the GDC portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-LIHC). There are 377 patient and 28 variables in the data provided. I used correlations, Fisher's exact test, lasso fit model, principal component analysis. In the end 3 of the factors are highly significant than others, namely: age, race, tumor stage. Different analysis confirms each other.
